# Auto_FTP_Uploader
This is was a project that i have written in Java for Automating the upload process from a Windows server to a FTP server. Originally this code came with a email alerting function when the upload fails. But it seems like the file I got didn't include that. I will probably add that later on. 

Java FTP script.

Note: This Java code is for automating the a file upload to a FTP server.
      Make sure to edit the Java file("FileTransferTest").

- run_FTP.bat should be in the same of main script .java file.

- You can use the batch file to run the .java file.


To run java file manually.

1. Open command prompt
2. Go to your .java path 
3. run this command -> javac nameofFile.java (Note: if no errors proceed to next step)
4. run this command -> java nameofFile  


Add the FTP library 

1. Download zip from https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/download_net.cgi
2. in the zip file you will need, commons-net-3.6, commons-net-3.6-sources
3. transfer or copy these files into your java 'lib' folder, should be under your jdk folder.

END.
